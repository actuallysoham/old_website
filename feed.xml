Life &amp; people in America are fascinating (just as life &amp; people in any other place) and here’s my brain dump on that.</p> <h2 id="a-portrait-of-the-average-person-i-see">A portrait of the average person I see</h2> <p>Seattle is probably the biggest city in the Pacific Northwest. It’s also a tech-hub. Most people I see are probably not from here. For some people, people really like bouldering. If I had to paint a portrait of the average person in their mid-late 20s, I see in Seattle, here’s how it would look like:</p> <ol> <li>A jacket - probably Columbia, TNF, Cotopaxi or … Arcteryx</li> <li>Hiking Boots - most likely Merrel Moabs</li> <li>Hiking pants - something from REI</li> <li>No umbrella. No seriously, I cannot stress how everyone here will tell you how an umbrella ‘is a sure-fire sign of a tourist in the PNW’.</li> </ol> <p>This is however distinct from undergraduates at UW. That profile would be:</p> <ol> <li>Hoodie/Sweatshirt</li> <li>Sweatpants</li> <li>Sneakers, a 70\% chance they’re AF1s.</li> </ol> <h2 id="climbing">Climbing</h2> <p>As opposed to hiking or mountaineering (I know right?).</p> <h2 id="cafes">Cafes</h2> <p>I happen to really like coffee and that was (I admit this is irresponsible of me) probably the biggest reason why I choose UW. So naturally, I had to explore as many cafes as I could in Seattle. Here’s an ever-evolving map! Here’s what I observe in Cafes: firstly, for folks from India, Starbucks in Seattle is exactly equivalent to your roadside chai tapri (tea shack). It’s too commonplace, cheap and mediocre at best.</p> <h2 id="capitalism">Capitalism</h2> <p>Trader Joe’s holy sh#%.</p> <h2 id="cars">Cars</h2> <p>Go-karting.</p> <h2 id="my-favorite-seattle-trivia">My favorite Seattle trivia</h2> <p>It’s so good I don’t want to give it away. And … I won’t. I’ll only tell you the first half, and ask me to finish this when we meet!</p>]]></content><author><name>Soham De</name></author><category term="random"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a 9-month long evolving ethnography]]></summary></entry></feed>
