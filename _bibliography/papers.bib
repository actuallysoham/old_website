  abstract={The dramatic increase in access to social media in the last decade in India has brought significant changes to the ways that a range of economic, cultural, and political aspects of social life are conducted. From using YouTube to plan vacations and nightly meals to using Instagram for brand management and Twitter for running political campaigns or social justice outreach, a broad range of engagements and economic activities alike are now either mediated through, or primarily driven by, social media activity. This collection of papers and talks from the proceedings of the Social Media and Society in India conference held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in April 2023. The talk summaries cover the conversations with practitioners on various domains from the impact of social media on journalism and activism to mental health, culture, and industry. The research papers here include peer reviewed original work presented at the conference on a range of topics including gender, urbanity, financial behavior, family vlogs, misinformation, and hate speech.},

  title={Closed Ranks: The Discursive Value of Military Support for Indian Politicians},
  author={Seth*, Agrima and De*, Soham and Arya, Arshia and Wilkinson, Steven and Singh, Sushant and Pal, Joyojeet},
  abstract={Influencers play a crucial role in shaping public narratives through information creation and diffusion in the Global South. While public figures from various walks of life and their impact on public discourse have been studied, defence veterans as influencers of the political discourse have been largely overlooked. Veterans matter in the public spehere as a normatively important political lobby. They are also interesting because, unlike active-duty military officers, they are not restricted from taking public sides on politics, so their posts may provide a window into the views of those still in the service. In this work, we systematically analyze the engagement on Twitter of self-described defence-related accounts and politician accounts that post on defence-related issues. We find that self-described defence-related accounts disproportionately engage with the current ruling party in India. We find that politicians promote their closeness to the defence services and nationalist credentials through engagements with defence-related influencers. We briefly consider the institutional implications of these patterns and connections},

  author={Sen, Anirban and De, Soham and Pal, Joyojeet},
  abstract={Staying relevant in the hearts and minds of the general populace is increasingly driven by social media footprint. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examine the online activity of a community of social media accounts engaged in collective action to keep the death of an Indian movie star, and its investigation, alive on social media. We find that the community develops de-facto hierarchies, which engineer large assemblages of social media activity online. The use of affordances, language, coercion, and temporal organization allows us unique insight both into how coordinated activity can keep an issue alive online, and also into how a dogma community fashions itself around an unwavering narrative.},

  author={De, Soham and Panda, Anmol and Pal, Joyojeet},
  abstract={Social Media is increasingly central to culture wars, and in recent years has been at the center of debates around the weaponization of peoples’ opinions in polarized situations. We examine one such issue, an attempt to allow schools and junior colleges to ban girls from wearing Hijab in India in the southern state of Karnataka, India, by studying Twitter messaging related to the issue in early 2022, when it was in the news. We find that the narrative supporting the ban of the Hijab on Twitter is primarily driven by a minority of highly-influential individuals who are predominantly male and polarised in favour of the ruling party, while the discourse against the ban relies largely on influencers from within the Muslim community. Our findings show that social media can be a useful tool to craft the contours of politically-motivated escalation in the Global South.},

  abstract={Databases of highly networked individuals have been indispensable in studying narratives and influence on social media. To support studies on Twitter in India, we present a systematically categorized database of accounts of influence on Twitter in India, identified and annotated through an iterative process of friends, networks, and self-described profile information, verified manually. We built an initial set of accounts based on the friend network of a seed set of accounts based on real-world renown in various fields, and then snowballed ``friends of friends" multiple times, and rank ordered individuals based on the number of in-group connections, and overall followers. We then manually classified identified accounts under the categories of entertainment, sports, business, government, institutions, journalism, civil society accounts that have independent standing outside of social media, as well as a category of ``digital first" referring to accounts that derive their primary influence from online activity. Overall, we annotated 11580 unique accounts across all categories. The database is useful studying various questions related to the role of influencers in polarization, misinformation, extreme speech, political discourse etc.},

  title={Catch, Corroborate and Communicate: The Contours of Professional fact-Checking In India},
  author={Arya, Arshia and De, Soham and Dash, Saloni and Pal, Joyojeet},
  abstract={The work of professional fact-checking involves three broad processes - selection of the issues that need to be fact-checked, verifying a story that is flagged as being a falsehood, and finally disseminating a fact-checked version of a story, each of which have unique challenges. We conducted in-depth interviews on their professional practice with fact-checkers of five major organizations that work in debunking stories daily, alongside conducted a large-scale analysis of the archives of fact-checked articles and studied the social media footprint of fact-checkers from these organizations. Our findings show that the outcomes of work with each of the three processes influence what stories get debunked by organizations, how much public impact they have, and the depth of debunking in each story, all of which in turn play a role in the scope and breadth of individual organizations’ impact. Our findings have implications from both the supply side of how organizations can place themselves within the fact-checking ecosystem, and from the demand side of how consumers can consider the work and positioning of their preferred fact-checkers.},
