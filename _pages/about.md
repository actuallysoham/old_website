I'm a PhD student at the [`University of Washington`](https://ischool.uw.edu/) and a part of the [`Center for Informed Public`](https://www.cip.uw.edu/), advised by [Martin Saveski](https://web.stanford.edu/~msaveski/). My research interests are broadly within [`Computational Social Science`](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1167742), which includes the study of misinformation and social media. I'm specifically interested in algorithms that help combat social harms and bring people together - let's chat if this sounds exciting!

Previously, I interned at [`Microsoft Research India`](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) under [Anirban Sen](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~anirban/) and at the [`University of Michigan`](https://www.si.umich.edu/) under [Joyojeet Pal](https://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/). I graduated magna cum laude from [`Ashoka University`](https://www.ashoka.edu.in) with a Gold Medal in Computer Science. Beyond academics, Iâ€™m a competent artist, photographer, archer and an incompetent pianist.
