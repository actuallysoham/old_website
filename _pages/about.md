My current research interests span [#CompSocSci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science#:~:text=Computational%20social%20science%20is%20the,simulate%2C%20and%20analyze%20social%20phenomena.) and [#ICT4D](https://ictd.org/). Specifically, I'm interested in misinformation, social media and information flow in online communities. I'm currently interning at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) under [Anirban Sen](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~anirban/) and [Joyojeet Pal](https://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/) (UMich Ann Arbor). I'm also studying quantitative features of social networks and computer-mediated communication with [Debayan Gupta](https://debayangupta.com). Previously, I’ve been a part of the [MPhasis Lab](https://ashoka.edu.in/ML2CT) (under [Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home) and [Subhashis Banerjee](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~suban/)) and [BharatSim](https://www.thoughtworks.com/engineering-research/bharatsim) (under [Debayan Gupta](https://debayangupta.com)).

I graduated magna cum laude from [AshokaUniv](https://www.ashoka.edu.in) with a Gold Medal in Computer Science. Beyond academics, I’m a competent artist, photographer, archer and an incompetent pianist.
